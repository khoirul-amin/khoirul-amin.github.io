	<h3 class="subhead mt-1">Hi.</h3>
	<p>
		I'm an open-source enthusiast and
		<a title="See me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/eamodio" target="_blank">maintainer</a>. I &#x2764;
		open-source — both building and contributing. I love the collaboration and the sharing of knowledge driven by
		the open-source movement.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the same time, open-source comes with a cost, of which gets paid by trading time and energy from other areas
		&mdash; for me it's usually sleep &#x1f4a4;, but sometimes also family. Of course, by sponsoring me and my work,
		you can't create time, but you can certainly help increase the reward aspect of trading this precious time and
		help ensure that it continues.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spend a lot of my &ldquo;free&rdquo; time building and maintaining
		<a title="Learn more about GitLens" href="https://gitlens.amod.io/" target="_blank">GitLens for VS Code</a>
		and have for well over 3 years now. From its very humble beginnings, GitLens has grown wildly beyond my
		expectations — in both its reach as well as its demands on my time and attention. GitLens now has over 4 million
		installs (~34M downloads &#x1F631;) and is used by teams of all sizes, from single devs to enterprise teams. I
		also author and maintain many other VS Code extensions (and have ideas for many more) as well as contribute to
		many open-source projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		&#x1f496; Thank you for your future sponsorship! And to my incredible sponsors &mdash; thank you so much for
		your contributions. I am truly humbled by your generosity and support.
